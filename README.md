# McDonaldsBOT

- A bot that creates multiple user accounts for the mcdonalds app and redeems a weekly coupon for each account.
- The coupon can also be received by scanning the QR code on the bill, so the application has also generated its own QR code
(QR code only had to include a valid date, the rest was not checked) and received coupons this way.
Tehnologies: javascript and Node.js
